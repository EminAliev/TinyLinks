# TinyLinks

TinyLinks is the original URL shortener that shortens your unwieldly links into more manageable and useable URLs.

# Building

It is best to use the python virtualenv tool to build locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/EminAliev/TinyLinks.git
$ cd TinyLinks
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py runserver
```
